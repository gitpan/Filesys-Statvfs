TO INSTALL RUN:
                                                                                                                       
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install
                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                       
During the 'make test', test.pl will try to test with '/' and then
open test.pl in the current directory and use that for the filehandle
test.
                                                                                                                       
Once installed, run 'perldoc Filesys::Statvfs' for more information.

Filesys::Statvfs - Perl extension for statvfs() and fstatvfs()
                                                                                                                     
SYNOPSIS

  use Filesys::Statvfs;
                                                                                                                     
   my($bsize, $frsize, $blocks, $bfree, $bavail,
      $files, $ffree, $favail, $flag, $namemax) = statvfs("/tmp");
                                                                                                                     
   #### Pass an open filehandle. Verify that fileno() returns a defined
   #### value. If you pass undef to fstatvfs you will get unexpected results
   my $fd = fileno(FILE_HANDLE);
   if(defined($fd)) {
	($bsize, $frsize, $blocks, $bfree, $bavail,
         $files, $ffree, $favail, $flag, $namemax) = fstatvfs($fd);
   }


DESCRIPTION

Interface for statvfs() and fstatvfs()
                                                                                                                       
Unless you need access to the bsize, flag, and namemax values,
you should probably look at using Filesys::DfPortable or
Filesys::Df instead. They will generally provide you with more
functionality and portability.
                                                                                                                       
The module should work with all flavors of Unix that implement the
statvfs() and fstatvfs() calls. This would include Linux, *BSD,
HP-UX, AIX, Solaris, Mac OS X, Irix, Cygwin, etc ...
                                                                                                                       
The statvfs() and fstatvfs() functions will return a list of
values, or will return undef and set $! if there was an error.
                                                                                                                       
The values returned are described in the statvfs/fstatvfs header or
the statvfs()/fstatvfs() man page.
                                                                                                                       
The module assumes that if you have statvfs(), fstatvfs() will
also be available.
