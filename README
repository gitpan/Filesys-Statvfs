TO INSTALL RUN:
	
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

For this module to install and work you will need
to have statvfs() on your system. A good way to tell if
it is there is to look for sys/statvfs.h in your 
include directory. (Usually /usr/include/)

If there is an error during the 'make' it is
possible that you do not have statvfs() on your system.
Another reason may be that the statvfs structure defined
in statvfs.h does not contain one or more of the fields that are
defined in Filesys.xs.

During the 'make test' test.pl will use statvfs()
to stat the root directory "/". If it fails it will
report the error, otherwise it will report all the 
standard fields in the statvfs structure. 

In the future I plan on having support for statfs()
and to to have all fields available for statvfs() depending
on the OS. For instance HP-UX has two extra non standard
fields in their statvfs structure.

Once installed run 'perldoc Filesys::Statvfs' and
'perldoc Filesys::Df' for more information.

If you have any problems or questions please email
me at IGuthrie@aol.com with "Filesys Module" in
the subject line.
