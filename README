SYNOPSIS

  use Filesys::Statvfs;
                                                                                                                     
   my($bsize, $frsize, $blocks, $bfree, $bavail,
      $files, $ffree, $favail, $flag, $namemax) = statvfs("/tmp");
                                                                                                                     
   #### Pass an open filehandle. Verify that fileno() returns a defined
   #### value. If you pass undef to fstatvfs you will get unexpected results
   my $fd = fileno(FILE_HANDLE);
   if(defined($fd)) {
	($bsize, $frsize, $blocks, $bfree, $bavail,
         $files, $ffree, $favail, $flag, $namemax) = fstatvfs($fd);

DESCRIPTION

Interface for statvfs() and fstatvfs()
                                                                                                                     
Unless you need access to the bsize, flag, and namemax values,
you should probably look at using Filesys::DfPortable or
Filesys::Df instead.
                                                                                                                     
The statvfs() and fstatvfs() functions will return a list of
values, or will return undef and set $! if there was an error.
                                                                                                                     
The values returned are described in the statvfs header or
the statvfs() man page.
                                                                                                                     
The module assumes that if you have statvfs(), fstatvfs() will
also be available.
                                                                                                                     

INSTALL
TO INSTALL RUN:
                                                                                                                     
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install
                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                     
During the 'make test', test.pl will try to test with '/' and then
open test.pl in the current directory and use that for the filehandle
test.
                                                                                                                     
Once installed, run 'perldoc Filesys::Statvfs' for more information.
